# **Infrastructure as Code Model Evaluation**

This repository contains high quality samples of IaC code that can be used to
validate trained models. It is meant to be excluded from training data.

## **Contributing - Getting Started** ðŸš€

Get familiar with the repo. The goal is to have examples for CDK, CFN, and TF
for all languages where applicable (e.g. JSON/YAML for CFN, all languages for
CDK) so if a resource is already created but is in written in a different
language, feel free to add support for a different one. Similar applies for
Terraform. We need examples for both the aws and awscc providers.

*Important:* Make sure every code block has a comment above it! These comments
need to be what you would expect a developer to type in as a prompt to
Amazon Q inline code completions.
